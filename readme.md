### 📦 Installation

- Download or clone the repository
- Copy the entire *Assets/PiDev* folder into your Unity project's *Assets* directory.
- You now have full access to all utilities, components, and editor tools.
- Some utilities depend on DoTween by Demigiant. A version of it is included in Assets/DOTween. Make sure to manually update this when necessary, its provided only for the example project to work.
- **Unity 2021.3 LTS** or newer is recommended. *(Older versions may work but are not officially tested.)*
